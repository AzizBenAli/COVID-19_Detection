# COVID-19 Detection Project

## Overview
This project aims to detect COVID-19 cases from X-ray images using machine learning techniques. The goal is to provide an automated tool that can assist medical professionals in identifying potential COVID-19 cases through X-ray images.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of X-ray images of COVID-19 positive cases, as well as X-ray images from healthy individuals (NORMAL). The dataset was collected from various sources, and each image has been preprocessed to be of uniform size and format.

## Model
We have employed a pre_trained deep learning model 'densenet121'.

## Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated on a separate test dataset to assess its accuracy and other relevant metrics. The confusion matrix is used to analyze the model's ability to distinguish between COVID-19 positive cases and healthy individuals.

## Results
The model achieved an accuracy of 99% on the test dataset.
